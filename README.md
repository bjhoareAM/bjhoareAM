Iâ€™m passionate about **digital collections, data partnerships, and open access projects**.  
I am employed at **Auckland Museum**, and my role allows me to engage with digital partnerships and large-scale batch uploads to platforms like Wikimedia Commons, Pinterest, Flickr, Google Arts & Culture, and GBIF.  
My interests include **metadata governance**, **digital preservation**, **data visualisations**, **linked open data**, and building tools to support GLAM institutions' contributions of open access content.
